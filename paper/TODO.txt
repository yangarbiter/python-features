Needed graphs:

1) Accuracy
Need:
- p@1, p@2, p@3 scores for the full dataset for whatever our most powerful model is (currently being trained)

2) Feature Predictive Power
Need:
- Yaoyuan is looking into ANOVA
(Have:
- "fet_value" field from our results shows most important features according to sklearn)

3) Defect Categories
Want:
- good definition of category of defects (could use python error message, but might be better to use clusters once we have those)
Need:
- model retrained for each category. (Ideally, for each category x for each missing feature, but reusing monolithic model would be a lot faster)

4) Diversity (Clustering)
Need:
- Leon is working on clustering
