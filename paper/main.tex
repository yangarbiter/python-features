\section{Introduction}

\emph{Placeholder Outline.} This text is an informal placeholder outline
only. 

\emph{Identify an important problem.} Support the claim that Python fault
localization for possibly-ill-typed student fragments is an important
problem. Likely steps: fault localization is important, Python is
important, incomplete code is important. First, software engineering is
important and expensive; testing, maintenance, and debugging are the
dominant activities in SE; localization and triage are key steps. Second, 
Python is increasingly used for pedagogy and industrial deployment, here
are some GitHub numbers about the rate of growth in Python projects
compared to C or Java, etc. Third, IDE tool use requires operating on code
fragments, here are some numbers from PythonTutor~\cite{Guo2013-vu}, generality, etc. 

\emph{Identify the properties of a good solution.} Pick your favorite
three. Some candidates: accuracy (cite Parnin/Orso paper an indicate that
it must be found within top three, etc., since humans will not read long
lists), generality (must apply to student code and incomplete fragments), 
scalability (must apply to hundreds of thousands of fragments, must present
real-time responses suitable for web/IDE use), agreement with subjective
judgments (must handle ``ambiguity'' the same way humans would when you
don't know whether to blame the use or the definition, etc.), efficiency
(must operate using a small number of dynamic runs, unlike Tarantula,
etc.). 

\emph{Show that the current state of the art is inadequate.} For each $x$ of
\{manual debugging, Python's default error messages,
Mycroft/Sherrloc/Tarantula/whatever\}, show that $x$ lacks at least one of the
desired properties listed above. 

\emph{Insights and special sauce.} What are the two or three good ideas
that we bring together to solve this problem? Some candidates: the use of
modern machine learning techniques (deep learning, etc.); the use of
tree-based contextual features to hit the sweet spot between syntax and semantics;
special handling of unsatisfied use-def type constraints (TBA); etc. 

\emph{What is our proposal?} We propose XYZ, an algorithm to do ABC. It
takes as input DEF. It has stages P, Q and R. It produces as output GHI. It
provides guarantees JKL. 

\emph{How will we evaluate it?} For each of the properties of a good
solution listed above, indicate how we will evaluate our contribution. What
evidence will we provide? Typically, for each property $x$, we support our
claim to $x$ with either a formal proof (e.g., our algorithm has $x$ by
construction), an empirical evaluation on software artifacts, or an
empirical evaluation on human subjects. In each case, indicate both the
evaluation metrics (e.g., if we care about efficiency, is it measured in
lines-per-second? if we care about precision, what is our non-standard
top-three metric) and success criteria (e.g., how will we define success?
what is the baseline we want to beat). For empirical evaluations, briefly
and implicitly argue that the results are likely to generalize by giving
the size of the sampled set.
