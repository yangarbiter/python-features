# Clustering Scripts

Requirements
============
Requires packages scipy / numpy and python-Levenshtein (python 3).

Data
====
Python
------
Python data is not included in the repository. Python data should take the form
of one file per program, where the last line of each file is a json object with
the key 'fix' corresponding to a python source.

OCaml
-----
OCaml data is included as the file ocaml-json. Each line has a json value
representing the AST of an OCaml program, as output by the ocaml-to-json utility
from nanomaly (https://github.com/ucsd-progsys/nanomaly)
